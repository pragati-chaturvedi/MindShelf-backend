This Medium article, "What is Blockchain Technology? Part 1: Blockchain Basics," provides a foundational understanding of blockchain technology. It explains blockchain as a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. The key aspects covered are the concept of a 'block' which holds a batch of transactions and its 'hash', a unique identifier. These blocks are chained together cryptographically making it tamper-proof. The distributed nature of the blockchain ensures no single point of failure and improves security.  The article highlights the immutability of the blockchain, meaning once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted, guaranteeing data integrity. The benefits include transparency, increased security, and efficiency in transactions. The article presents the basic structure and features of blockchain technology without delving into complex algorithms or specific implementations.
