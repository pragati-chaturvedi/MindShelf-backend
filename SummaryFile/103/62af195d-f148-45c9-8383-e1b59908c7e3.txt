This Medium article provides a foundational understanding of blockchain technology. It begins by explaining that a blockchain is essentially a distributed, immutable, and secure ledger. It emphasizes the decentralized nature of blockchain, contrasting it with centralized systems where a single authority controls the data. The article details how data is organized into blocks, which are then cryptographically linked together to form a chain. Each block contains a timestamp and cryptographic hash of the previous block, making it tamper-proof. The distributed nature ensures no single point of failure and enhances security through consensus mechanisms. The author also touches upon the benefits of blockchain such as transparency, security, and efficiency compared to traditional systems.
