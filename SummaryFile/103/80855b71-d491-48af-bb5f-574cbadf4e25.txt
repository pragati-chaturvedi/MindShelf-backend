This article, titled "What is Blockchain Technology? Part 1: Blockchain Basics," provides a foundational understanding of blockchain technology. It explains that blockchain is essentially a distributed, decentralized, public ledger used to record transactions across many computers. The key characteristics highlighted are decentralization, immutability, and transparency.  The author emphasizes that the blockchain structure is built from 'blocks' which contain transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, thus forming a chain. This chaining ensures immutability because altering any previous block would require recalculating all subsequent block hashes, making it easily detectable. The article further discusses the benefits of blockchain, such as increased security, reduced fraud, and enhanced transparency due to the publicly verifiable nature of the ledger. The article uses layman's terms to explain complex concepts like hashing and distributed consensus.
